## React Calculator

The react calculator project has three components, the Calculator, Display and Button components. The function of the Display component is to render the inputs of the user and the results. The function of the Button component is to handle the input from the user.

The idea behind the app is to generate a algebraic expression in the showed in the Display component to be evaluated with the mathjs library.
